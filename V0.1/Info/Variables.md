# V3rsa V0.1🐤 - Variables
In V3rsa, variables are **storing units** that can hold a single value. They support most data types — **strings, integers, floats, and booleans** — but **not functions**.
***
## Declaration
Variables in V3rsa V0.1 are declared using the `vrb` keyword:
```v3rs
vrb key = "gold"
```
This declares a variable `key` with the value `"gold"`.
***
## Operators
You can assign values using:
* `=` (assignment)
* `+=` (add and assign)
* `-=` (subtract and assign)
* `*=` (multiply and assign)
* `/=` (divide and assign)
* And other arithmetic-based assignment operators.
```v3rs
vrb x = 2
x += 3   $$ Now x is 5
x *= 2   $$ Now x is 10
```

## Constant Variables?
Not yet!
V0.1 does **not** support constant variables — that's planned for a future version.
